# X Education Lead Conversion Model

## Problem Statement

X Education, an online course provider, faces challenges with its lead conversion process. Despite generating a considerable number of leads daily, the conversion rate remains low. To enhance efficiency, the company aims to identify potential leads, or 'Hot Leads,' with a higher likelihood of conversion. This project focuses on building a model to assign lead scores, facilitating targeted communication efforts and improving the lead conversion rate to approximately 80%.

## Data

The dataset provided contains approximately 9000 data points with various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable, 'Converted,' indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). Additionally, categorical variables may have levels such as 'Select,' treated as null values. Data exploration and preprocessing are necessary to handle these issues effectively.

## Goals of the Case Study

1. **Build a Logistic Regression Model**: Develop a model to assign lead scores ranging from 0 to 100 based on features associated with conversion likelihood. Higher scores indicate 'Hot Leads' with a greater chance of conversion.

2. **Address Future Requirements**: Ensure the model's flexibility to accommodate future changes and additional requirements from the company. This involves adapting the model to handle specific problems outlined by the company and incorporating adjustments as needed.

## Implementation

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing outliers.

2. Model Development: Build a Logistic Regression model using relevant features to predict lead conversion probabilities. Fine-tune the model to optimize performance metrics.

3. Lead Scoring: Assign lead scores based on the model's predictions, categorizing leads as 'Hot' or 'Cold' based on their conversion likelihood.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, ensuring it meets the company's requirements and objectives.

5. Documentation: Document the entire process, including data preprocessing steps, model development, evaluation results, and insights gained. Provide clear explanations and interpretations for stakeholders.
